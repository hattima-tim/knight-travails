# knight-travails

This is a visual representation of a [problem](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails) I had to solve as part of [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject). The problem was to write a program that will find the shortest path a knight can take, to move between two positions on a chess board.

See the project live [here](https://hattima-tim.github.io/knight-travails/).

## A bit about the program
The program uses graph data structure and breadth-first-search algorithm for finding the shortest path.

## Challenges

- The first challenge I faced with the problem is the graph data structure. Before the project, I did not know what it is and how it works. So, I had to learn about this.

- After that, I had to choose between dfs and bfs for searching the shortest path. This was the hardest part. After trying to implement both and spending a lot of time, I decided to focus on just bfs and was able to solve the problem with it.
